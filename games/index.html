<i>Hello, test subject.</i> Welcome to the new work in progress games page! The first thing you'll notice, is that there
are multiple categories now - for competition and Notch's games.<br>
The main competition I am currently focusing on is J4k, where Notch submitted games as well. You'll find a list of
