    <h4>INSTRUCTIONS:</h4>
    The earth is under attack (again) by aliens. Your ship is indestructable, but the earth isn't.<br>
    You must save the earth by destroying the alien mother ship without letting any alien ships pass.<br>
    The aliens only need 3 ships to destroy earth. The alien mothership has shields wich your bullets cannot
    penetrate.<br><br>
    use the arrow keys to move left or right. <BR>
    press the up key to fire.<br><br>
    GOOD LUCK.
