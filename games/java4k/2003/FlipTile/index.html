description: Click on a tile to flip that tile and all the adjacent tiles. The object of the game is make all of the tiles on the screen disappear.
instructions: The first few are easy, so don't get too cocky. You are given a maximum number of flips to complete each level by. Every time you go over your maximum, you lose some of your slack. If you run out of slack, the game is over! Do you have what it takes?
installing: Open the page with a browser that supports applets. A better solution is in progress.
