description: Try to swat the ants up or down with the swatter to make them go in the pants. Red ants are worth 3, black ants 1, and blue ants 0 points. If you hit a blue ant, the swatter will be stuck. Wiggle the mouse around to unstick it. After 6 groups of ants has gone by, bug poison will cause the ants that escaped to go down to zero. If 25% of the ants escape before the 6th group has gone by, the game is over.
instructions: Use mouse to move the swatter.
installing: Open the page with a browser that supports applets. A better solution is in progress.
