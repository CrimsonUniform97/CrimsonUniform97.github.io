description: A failed attempt at Ludum Dare 12. The theme was 'Tower', so Notch thought he'd make a game about someone in a spaceship, towing wrecked ships around - with Wing Commander style graphics.
instructions: Use mouse to look around.
development: Development was recorded and made into a <a href="https://youtu.be/7siUiOR9yxA">timelapse</a>. Only one released version is known to exist.
