    <h2>Hello</h2>
    My name is Markus Persson, and I'm a programmer. You can call me "Notch".<br>
    If you want to, you can email me at <a href="mailto:notch@mojang.com">notch@mojang.com</a>. Be warned that
    my spam filter eats far too many real emails, though.<br>

    </p>
    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
        I currently run my own company called Mojang Specifications, where I'm currently developing a game called <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used to work for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.jalbum.net/">Jalbum</a> as a
        programmer. Or developer. Or code guru. We got to pick our own titles. :D
    </p>
    <p>
        Before that, I worked for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.king.com/">King.com</a>
        as a game programmer for 4.5 years. I wrote games like <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.king.com/opengame.jsp?game=funnyfarm">Funny
            Farm</a>, <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.king.com/opengame.jsp?game=luxor">Luxor</a>, and
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.king.com/opengame.jsp?game=carnivalshootout">Carnival
            Shootout</a>.
        I mostly did actionscript programming there, but also some java for the game verification code.<br>
        Recently, I've done some work in C++. It's a powerful language and fun, but the retarded compilation system
        makes me cry a bit.

    </p>
    <p>
        I was one of the founders of a unique mmorpg called <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.wurmonline.com/">Wurm Online</a>. I'm no longer
        active there.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I also make music under the name Markus Alexei. It's electronica, and releases are very far apart.<br>

            competition</a>.<br>
        Most recently, I made <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.mojang.com/notch/bunnypress/">Bunny Press</a>, a
        somewhat violent puzzle game.<br>
        The first time I competed, I made a game called <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.mojang.com/notch/ld12/breaking/">Breaking the

        It finished third in the <a

        competiton.<br>
    </p>

        There's the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.mojang.com/notch/mario/">Infinite
            Mario Bros</a> game I wrote for some mario themed competition. The source code is public domain now!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2.5d Engines:</b><br>
        I started work on an rpg called <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.mojang.com/notch/chambered/">Legend of the
            Chambered</a>, but lost interest for some reason.<br>
        I made a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.mojang.com/notch/flashmaze/">first
            person shooter prototype in flash</a>. It uses graphics from the <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://freedoom.sourceforge.net/">freedoom</a> project.<br>
        There's also a <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.mojang.com/notch/misc/3dck_d0/">flash doom level
            renderer</a>. It doesn't have any fancy textures, though.<br>
        I also wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.mojang.com/notch/hl2rpg/">dungeon
            master type game engine in java</a> using similar techniques. I also have a <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.mojang.com/notch/loc/">DM engine in flash</a>,
        but that one uses static graphics.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Even nerdier:</b><br>
        I made a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.mojang.com/notch/logichex/">turing
            complete hexagon based cellular automata thingie</a>. It's REALLY nerdy.<br>
        And then I started making a <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110702020522/http://www.mojang.com/notch/eoo/">40x30 pixel ega color
            remake of Eye of the Beholder 2</a>. I should finish it.<br>
