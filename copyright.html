    This website is not in any way associated with the original Intra Clinic website or its original owners and
    operators. However we do act in part as an archival site and claim no ownership of that content. These parts of the
    site will have a disclaimer detailing who the content is a copyright of. Furthermore, if a piece of content not
    owned by us and is used as a part of a page, it will be detailed in the copyright disclaimer at the bottom of the
    page. If something is not credited in the copyright disclaimer then it should be assumed that it is a copyright of
    the new site and its operators (in rare cases though this will simply be an oversight on our part). Please keep this
    in mind when viewing the website, especially if you are viewing the archive part of the site.
