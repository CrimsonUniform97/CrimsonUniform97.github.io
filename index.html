  <p>The Intra Clinic was originally started by Markus "Notch" Persson and even predates Mojang by a year or two. The
    old website was operational from around 2001-2006. It served as a place for Markus to share his music and games
    from. Ever since it went offline, The Intra Clinic's domain has been up for grabs. Now, it has a new lease on life
    as an archive of his work. Make sure to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/5a6x7AY">Discord server</a> to discuss
    anything related!
