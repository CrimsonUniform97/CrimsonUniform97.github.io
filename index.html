The Intra Clinic was originally started by Markus "Notch" Persson and even predates Mojang by a year
or two. The old website was operational from around 2001-2006. It served as a place for Markus to
share his music and games from. Ever since it went offline, The Intra Clinic's domain has been up
for grabs. Now, it has a new lease on life as an archive of his work. Make sure to join our Discord
server to discuss anything related!
