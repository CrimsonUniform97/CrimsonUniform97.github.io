<I>Hello and, again, welcome to the IntraClinic computer-aided enrichment center.</I><BR>
The main difference is the new categories, since we are moving from archiving only Notch's content to some game compos,
and some other media as well. Nothing is currently finished, so here's just some old list of stuff I'd like to archive
here:
<UL>
  <LI>Markus 'Notch' Persson</LI>
  <LI>Java4k competition</LI>
  <LI>TinyGame competition</LI>
  <LI>the5k competition</LI>
  <LI>Bigjam</LI>
  <LI>Tigjam</LI>
  <LI>Zachtronics' Infinifranchise</LI>
