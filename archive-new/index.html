/* <I>Hello and, again, welcome to the IntraClinic computer-aided enrichment center.</I><BR>
The main difference is the new categories, since the old archive had everything in one place and it was kinda hard to
navigate. Nothing is currently finished, so here's just some WIP description: */
<HR>

<I>Everything here is made by Markus 'Notch' Persson, and thus all rights go towards him.</I><BR>
Markus 'Notch' Persson is a Swedish game developer mainly known for his tiny game called <A
  HREF="http:/omniarchive.uk">Minecraft</A>. What most people don't know, is that he made a ton of other smaller - and
even bigger games, programs, websites and even music that fell into obscurity. Our goal is to preserve all of it in a
playable form for everyone.

// Some temporary navigation thing, will change a lot:

[ Games | <A HREF="">Websites</A> | <A HREF="">Music</A> | <A HREF="">Other</A> ]<BR>
// Should the go-to-year thing be here as well?
