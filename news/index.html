<B>HTML 3.2</B><BR>
<EM>6th February 2024 by DEJVOSS</EM><BR>
To ensure compatibility with basically everything now, (most of) the site is now HTML3.2! Also rewrote the code to be
much cleaner, no more closing tags that never started! In terms of new games being found, there hasn't been much
activity, but hopefully I'll revamp the archive page and add newer stuff to it soon enough. Stay tuned!<BR>

Phew, I really should use the news section whenever I update the site. Thanks to superllama on Discord, we now have the
original Takns jar (previously we only had a recompiled version from the source code), and... (applause, please) -
Dachon4k! This means we now have every Java4k game that notch has ever made!<BR><BR>

release linked may not be completely up to date, but they are the version we
recommend if you want to try to play some of the Java games we have hosted

recommend installing the latest version of Java.<BR><BR>Our <A HREF="https://theintraclinic.com/download/java">
