                    Woah! You have found the super seecret site test page! This is where I'll be testing new web layouts
                    and similar stuff. Stay tuned!<br>-Dejv<br>
                    Welcome to The Intra Clinic. The best place to learn about Markus "Notch" Persson and his creations.
                    The site was originally founded by Notch around the year 2001, and predates Mojang by at least three
                    years. It was used for hosting his early content such as Wurm Online, other smaller games which are
                    all lost to time music, and of course - cryptic messages. The website was abandoned in the 2006s as
                    Notch moved his creations to Mojang.com, and the website finally shut down on 20th of August 2009.
                    Since then, it was up for grabs, until 2021 when a group of archivists formerly known as "Markus
                    Archival Community", now rebranded to "The Intra Clinic", bought the website for historical
                    purposes. A great place to start is the archive page, where you'll find everything that Notch ever
                    created.
