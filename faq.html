  <b>How to run applets in my browser?</b>
    First, you need to install a browser that still supports them. We recommend <a href="https://www.palemoon.org/">Pale
      Moon</a>, it is still being updated and can run both Java and Flash. After you download it, go to your Java
    settings by typing "Configure Java" in the Windows search, and select the first result. Go to the security tab. Make
    sure you have enabled "Enable Java Content for browser and Web Start applications". Set the security level to High,
    and finally hit "Edit Site List", then click "Add" and type "https://theintraclinic.com" (without the "") to the
    field. Click OK on both the Java security windows. Now open Pale Moon and you should be ready to go!<br>
    This is how it should look like:<br>
