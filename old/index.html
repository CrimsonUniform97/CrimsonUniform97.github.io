Welcome to The Intra Clinic. The best place to learn about Markus "Notch" Persson and his creations. The site was
originally founded by Notch around the year 2001, and predates Mojang by at least three years. It was used for hosting
his early content such as Wurm Online, other smaller games which are all lost to time music, and of course - cryptic
messages. The website was abandoned in the 2006s as Notch moved his creations to Mojang.com, and the website finally
shut down on 20th of August 2009. Since then, it was up for grabs, until 2021 when a group of archivists formerly known
as "Markus Archival Community", now rebranded to "The Intra Clinic", bought the website for historical purposes. A great
place to start is the archive page, where you'll find everything that Notch ever created.
