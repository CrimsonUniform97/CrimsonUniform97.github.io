  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>The Intra Clinic was originally started by Markus &quot;Notch&quot; Persson and even
    predates Mojang by a year or two. The old website was operational from around 2001-2006. It served as a
    place for Markus to share his music and games from. Ever since it went offline, The Intra Clinic's domain
    has been up for grabs. Now, it has a new lease on life.</p>
