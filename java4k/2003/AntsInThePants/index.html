<h3>Description</h3>
Try to swat the ants up or down with the swatter to make them go in the pants<br>
Red ants are worth 3, black ants 1, and blue ants 0 points<br>
If you hit a blue ant, the swatter will be stuck. Wiggle the mouse around to unstick it.<br>
After 6 groups of ants has gone by, bug poison will cause the ants that escaped to go down to zero<br>
If 25% of the ants escape before the 6th group has gone by, the game is over.<br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
Use mouse to move the swatter.
<h3>Installing</h3>
Either open the page with a browser that supports applets, or download <a href="index_original.html">this page</a> and
<a href="pants.jar">the JAR</a> (make sure they are in the same folder!) and run them using appletviewer:
