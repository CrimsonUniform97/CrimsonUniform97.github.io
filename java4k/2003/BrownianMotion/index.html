description: The following applet is a tiny game demonstrating the unpredictability of "random" gas-particle-like motion.<br>Actually all collisions here are elastic and obey the laws of physics. The only "randomness" is the initial velocities of the particles. In other words, the Brownian motion is not really a random motion.<br>This is actually a demonstration of a simple "self" thread created within the Applet class. This is of course not a good programming style. Instead, it is intended to show how a simple application may be constructed with a single class.
instructions: The aim of the game is to "hit" the red particles by clicking on them. The level increases as more particles are hit.<br>A primitive status bar shows the current level, the number of hits, the number of mis-hits and the number of hits to reach the next level.<br>A mis-hit is a "hit" to a particle that is not red. Completing level 9 will win the game.<br>NOTE - YOU DO NOT NEED TO CLICK EACH RED BALL!
installing: Open the page with a browser that supports applets. A better solution is in progress.
