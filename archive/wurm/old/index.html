                                    Right now we're just a bunch of programmers working on Wurm Online, and none of us
                                    can draw better than <a href="img/art.gif">this</a>. It's very sad, I know.<br>
                                    We need texture artists, 2d artists (icons for inventory mostly), 3d modelers and 3d
                                    animators. We also need a lead artist to design the overall feeling for the game and
                                    make sure that all the art fits together.<br>
                                    We can't pay you anything right now, but if you're the right guy/gal for the job,
                                    you'll get a nice portion of the revenue sharing program.<br>

                                    So if you're an artistic kind of guy who wants nothing else than to design your own

                                    Wurm Online will be a community-centric fantasy MMORPG fully developed in java.<br>
                                    Gameplay will be free at first, but when you wish to develop your character beyond
                                    basic skills, you're going to have to pay a monthly fee.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The world will have a real economy with a fixed pool of money and resources, and
                                    almost all items in the world will be created by other players.<br>
                                    When the game is first launched, it will pretty much just only be a huge forest, and
                                    it will be up to the players to build the towns and create the items needed for both
                                    everyday use and more exotic practices.<br>
                                    Wurm Online will neither have levels nor hitpoints. Instead, you have a set of
                                    skills that define your character, and a list of any unhealed wounds the character
                                    has.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Gameplay is expected to be very down to earth and community-based for most players,
                                    with each town serving as a small community.<br>
                                    Towns will also remain safe as long as the computer controlled guards are alive. You
                                    won't be able to attack other players or perform any other illegal activity inside
                                    the town without first killing all the guards.<br>
                                    Outside the towns, however, you can do anything you want, but performing illegal
                                    activities will lower your status in the nearby villages.<br>

                                    You can see the map for the small test island <a href="img/map.gif">here</a>. The
                                    starting position is on the peak in the center of the map.<br>
                                    For reference, the size of that island is about 0.4% of the total world size of the
                                    finished game.<br>
