    <h2>Selling silver coins for real life money?</h2>
    This is what we think would happen if we did sell (but not buy) silver coins for real-life money

    <h3>Direct effects on wealth in the game</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>People with much real-life money will become rich in wurm, if they choose to, and think it's worth doing so
        <li>People who don't want to spend real-life money will make their money in wurm from playing
    </ul>

    <b>Result:</b> Some people will become rich with very little effort.<br>
    <b>Desirable:</b> No.<br>


    <h3>Distribution of wealth</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>There are three things to spend money on in wurm; deeds/upkeep, goods, and services
        <li>All goods in wurm are made by players, and most(*) services are performed by players
        <li>A rich player who buys goods or services in the game gives money to a poor player
    </ul>


    <b>Result:</b> If a rich player wants to be able to use his wealth in any other way than buying deeds, he makes it
    easier
    for other players to make money in the game, and he enables a proper economy<br>
    <b>Desirable:</b> Yes, very<br>
    <b>Notes:</b> While we want to keep the game player run, we might add npc services for very boring tasks, such as
    mail delivery. Personal traders is a service already performed by the NPCs.


    <h3>Sale of silver coins</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The wurm store sells silver coins for a fixed price
        <li>When players that play a lot make enough money, they can sell it to players that pay a lot for less than the
            wurm store
        <li>Silver coins will feel much more valuable
    </ul>

    <b>Result:</b> Mojang makes more money, and in theory it becomes possible to make money by playing wurm a lot<br>
    <b>Desirable:</b> Arguably<br>
    <b>Notes:</b> The sale of silver coins (or other goods) outside of wurm would not be supported by mojang, but it's
    also not forbidden. It's up to the players<br>


    <h3>Inflation and long term effects</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Buying silver coins from the web store increases the money in the world. Buying from another player leaves
            it constant
        <li>Silver coins getting added to the game economy at a faster rate than the player count leads to inflation
        <li>Mojang can adjust the inflation by only returning a part of the upkeep payments for deeds to the game
            economy
    </ul>

    <b>Result:</b> Mojang can effectively control the amount of silver coins in the game<br>
    <b>Desirable:</b> Yes. Inflation is very bad<br>
    <b>Notes:</b> The cut that is removed from upkeep payments needs to be very carefully balanced to make sure the
    silver coins/player stays constant. This means it will have to be in relation to the number of silver coins bought
    by rich players, and the growth rate of the player base.


    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    We think the effects of selling silver coins are very good, and would make wurm a more interesting game.<br>
