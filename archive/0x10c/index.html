                <h4>A New Game</h4>
                <div class="descr">
                    <p>Hi, I'm Notch, and this is my new game. It's going to be a space game, and it's quite ambitious!
                    </p>
                    <p>The game is still extremely early in development, but like we did with Minecraft, we expect to
                        release it early
                        and let the players help me shape the game as it grows.</p>
                    <p>The cost of the game is still undecided, but it's likely there will be a monthly fee for joining
                        the Multiverse as we
                        are going to emulate all computers and physics even when players aren't logged in. Single player
                        won't have any recurring fees.</p>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>Backstory and Setting</h4>
                <div class="descr">
                    <p>In a parallel universe where the space race never ended, space travel was gaining popularity
                        amongst corporations and rich individuals.</p>

                    <p>In 1988, a brand new deep sleep cell was released, compatible with all popular 16 bit computers.
                        Unfortunately, it used big endian, whereas
                        the DCPU-16 specifications called for little endian. This led to a severe bug in the included
                        drivers, causing a requested sleep of
                        <code>0x0000&nbsp;0000&nbsp;0000&nbsp;0001</code> years to last for
                        <code>0x0001&nbsp;0000&nbsp;0000&nbsp;0000</code> years.
                    </p>

                    <p>It's now the year 281 474 976 712 644 AD, and the first lost people are starting to wake up to a
                        universe on the brink of extinction,
                        with all remote galaxies forever lost to red shift, star formation long since ended, and massive
                        black holes dominating the galaxy.

                <h4>Game Features</h4>
                <div class="descr">
                    <p>The game is still very early in development, but here is a list of things we hope to include:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><del><a href="doc/hardscifi.txt">Hard science fiction</a></del>. Update: GAH, NO! I'm
                            focusing on fun gameplay instead. I still want to get corrected on glaring scientific
                            errors, though.
                        <li>Lots of engineering.
                        <li>Fully working computer system.
                        <li>Space battles against the AI or other players.
                        <li>Abandoned ships full of loot.
                        <li>Duct tape!
                        <li>Seamlessly landing on planets.
                        <li>Advanced economy system.
                        <li>Random encounters.
                        <li>Mining, trading, and looting.
                        <li>Single and multi player connected via the multiverse.
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>The Generator and the Computer</h4>
                <div class="descr">
                    <p>Each ship has a generator capable of producing a fixed wattage, and everything you connect to it
                        drains
                        wattage. A cloaking field, for example, might require almost all the power from the generator,
                        forcing you
                        to turn off all computers and dim all lights in order to successfully cloak.</p>
                    <p>The computer in the game is a fully functioning emulated 16 bit CPU that can be used to control
                        your
                        entire ship, or just to play games on while waiting for a large mining operation to finish.</p>
                    <p>Full specifications of the CPU will be released shortly, so the more programatically advanced of
                        you can
                        get a head start.</p>
