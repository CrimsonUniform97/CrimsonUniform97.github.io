    <h3>Overview</h3>
    joXSI is a free, open source .xsi file importer for java.<br>
    The goal is to have joXSI support everything in the xsi file format, including inverse kinematics and skinned
    animation.<br>
    <br>

    (It can take a few seconds before the model shows up after the window is visible.. have patience)

    <h3>Status</h3>
    joXSI is currently far from done. It doesn't even have a version number yet.<br>
    So far, it does the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Parses all templates for xsi files version 3.5
        <li>Builds vertex lists for vertex positions, colors, normals and up to four texture units
        <li>Applies all FCurves in a clip on command (this means it supports simple srt animation)
        <li>If there is an envelope, they are automatically applied to the vertex lists (this means it supports skinned
            animation)
        <li>Loads a texture by name. This is the ONLY thing it does with materials so far.
        <li>Renders the scene via JOGL/JSR 231
    </ul>
