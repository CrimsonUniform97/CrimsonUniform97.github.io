                                The mini-quest is a bit more entertaining now, with a buggy pair of doors
                                on the bottom floor. I'll fix those for 0.2.1.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The equipment will work for the next version. Honest. There will be
                                Defence and Attack values for the characters, and they will affect
                                how much damage they take and how much they can damage the enemies.

                                <li>The levels work as they should.</li>
                                <li>Stairs. And they work.</li>
                                <li>Added a development mode (turned on in 0.2.0). Press F12 to throw a
                                    Staff of Creation, then use it to get a very unsupported window
                                    where you can create and modify items.</li>
                                <li>The game should run at the same speed on all computers.</li>
                                <li>Fixed the mozilla/netscape bug.</li>
                                <li>Made a stand-alone version of the game (not an applet).</li>
                                <li>Tons of internal clean-up.. as usual.</li>

                                Yeah, there we go. Fighting finally works. Unfortunately, the game doesn't
                                currently care if you're actually using a weapon or not.. you do the same
                                ammount of damage no matter what you use to attack.

                                <li>Fighting. Right click the hands of a character from the
                                    party-menu to attack. When you attack, the name of the character
                                    that attacked turns gray, and you can't use that character until the
                                    name turns white again. This also prevents you from moving away
                                    from the enemy directly after attacking.</li>
                                <li>Added some stats to the status-screen. Just HP and Mana for now.</li>
                                <li>Implemented healing potions and added a backsack full of them next
                                    to the pressure-plate.</li>
                                <li>Doors open way faster now.</li>

                                I changed the inner loop in both texturemappers (vertical and horizontal)
                                to use fixed math interpolation and gained a LOT of speed. Made me happy.
