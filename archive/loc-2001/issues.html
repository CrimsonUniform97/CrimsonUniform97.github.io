                        <li><b>It doesn't work in netscape</b> (Fixed in 0.2.0)
                            <p>
                                Or was it just mozilla? Anyway, this is a known bug with how
                                netscape/mozilla handles applets in jar-files. This will be fixed
                                if I someday find it worthwile to write work-around for other people's
                                bugs.

                        <li><b>Sometimes items will seem to dissapear</b> (Fixed in 0.2.0)
                            <p>
                                This happens VERY rarely and has to do with how I repaint the applet.
                                I only repaint the areas that need to be repainted, but sometimes items
                                don't get drawn as a result of some strange chase-case I haven't found yet.
                                Since just the graphics for the item is missing, one solution is to open
                                and leave a backpack or character equipment-screen.
