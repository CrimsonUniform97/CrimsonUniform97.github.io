                                    Legend of the Chambered is a first person dungeon romp, similar to games
                                    like Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder, in the form of a java-applet.
                                    When I first started this project, my intention was just to try to figure
                                    out how you could go about to code an engine like the one in Dungeon Master,
                                    but the more functionality I added, the more fun this project became, and
                                    now I've decided to make a full game out of it.

                                        to the game</a>, let
                                    the applet load, click it (to give it focus) and you're ready to go.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To move around, use 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'q' and 'e' on your keyboard. 'W' and
                                    's' moves the party forwards and backwards, 'a' and 'd' moves is sideways,
                                    and 'q' and 'e' turns it around.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To see some information and the equipment of the characters in your party,
                                    simply click their portraits. If you click on the portrait again, you will go
                                    back to the party screen.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To pick up an item from the ground of any character's equipment, simply click
                                    the item. You can then click on the ground or in your inventory to release it.
                                    If you release an item of the right type in the equipment-slots on a character,
                                    the character will equip that item. For example, if you place a helmet in the
                                    helmet-slot, the helmet will provide protection for that character.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you want to use or activate an object, right click on it. This counts for
                                    everything that is usable in the game, like buttons, levers, healing potions
                                    and backpacks. If you with to use an item on another item or object in the world,
                                    pick up the item you wish to use and right click on the item or object you
                                    wish to use it with. For example, using an arrow on a quiver places the arrow
                                    in the quiver. Using a quiver while not holding anything removes an arrow from the
                                    quiver. Some items (like healing potions) can be used on the character portraits.

                                    Legend of the Chambered is very much under development, and will be so for
                                    a random period of time. It is very possible that the project will just die
                                    if noone (including me) shows any intrest in it for a long time. There will
                                    also be bugs, lacking features and silly placeholders that might ruin the
                                    mood of the game. But I will release new versions of it as often as I can,
                                    and if anyone comes with any good suggestions, I will add that to the game.

                                    I also desperatly need someone to join this project on the creative side,
                                    to come up with a better plot than the one I have planned (no, I won't tell
                                    you what it is yet.. it's silly), to draw graphics for the game and to
                                    design the levels. If you feel you could add anything to this project,
                                    please <a href="#contact">contact me</a>! You will have full artistic freedom
                                    as long as I like your plans, and the things you come up with actually
                                    CAN be implemented in java.

                                    The graphics for the character portraits has been stolen from
                                    "The Summoning", an rpg by SSI from 1992 or something like that.
                                    The graphics for the mummy has been stolen from Dungeon Master.
                                    All of the stolen graphics are just placeholders and will be replaced
                                    for original graphics before the final version of the game.
