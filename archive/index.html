  According to an interview, Markus Persson started coding at the age of 7 - that was around 1986 or 1987.
  Notch's first game was a "very basic text adventure" he made at the age of eight, 1987 or 1988. It is currently
  unknown if any of these games or notch's first Commodore 128 are still with Notch or his parents.

  <a href="/archive/bitseven/">BitSeven Productions</a> was Notch's first "studio", under which he created the earliest
  known games. He shared screenshots and some basic info about the games in an interview in 2011. All BitSeven games
  were created for DOS using the Turbo Pascal integrated development environment. None of these games are archived, they
  were never shared in the first place. All you can do is check out the screenshots, with original descriptions written
  by Notch!

  <a href="/web/">TheIntraClinic.com</a> was a website which Notch started around this time. It featured games, music
  and other interesting things, which are all currently lost to time. The website stopped being paid for in 2009, and
  now it serves as an archive on Notch's games.

  <a href="loc-2001/">Legend of the Chambered</a> is the oldest known game released on The IntraClinic in July 2001, and
  is also the first game of this title. It was a first person dungeon romp, similar to games like Dungeon Master - in
  the form of a java applet. It started as an experimental engine for this type of games, but Notch liked working on it
  so he kept expanding it for a while. Multiple versions were released, however none is currrently archived.

  Dachon B was a multiplayer j3D gravity thruster type game with collision detection, a console and a sound engine. It
  was being worked on around the same time as Stark, and released around May 2002. Development was cancelled due to
  Notch realizing j3D being too slow to make anything "real" in. The game alongside a screenshot is currently lost.<br>

<li>
  <a href="stark/">Stark</a> was a j3D 2.5 dimensional graphics engine, whose main functionality as loading DOOM WADs.
  It was being developed around the same time as Dachon B, and it released around May. Almost all DOOM levels rendered
  perfectly, except the sky in DOOM 2 levels. Notch lost interest and abandoned the project after having an issue with
  sprite rendering. He also later released the source code. Only the website is currently archived, making the game
  itself, the j3D version and the source code lost.<br>

  <a href="wurm/">WURM Online</a> is an MMO RPG that Notch worked on with Rolf Jansson, who founded Mojang AB together.
  Development started sometime in 2003. Notch was developing the game's client until 2007, when he left the company,
  which later changed it's name. There is a lot more about Wurm, check out the dedicated page.<br>

  Mojang's SiteApplet was an applet that would load if you entered the Mojang website. There was a
  big C-shaped “Mojang Specifications” logo, and when you clicked it, it split into four half-sized logos that bounce
  apart a little. When you clicked any of them, they again split and bounced apart. After the 5th split the parts
  vanished after bouncing.<br>
