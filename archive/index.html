  <h2>Archive</h2>
  <p>This is the main directory for everything that we have archived. While we primarily archive the works of Markus
    "Notch" Persson, we do archive others, like Infiniminer. See the topic directory below for all the games in that
    topic, or take a look at the list of featured games.

  <h3>The early ages (1987-199X/200X)</h3>
  <h4>Childhood</h4>
  <p>
    According to an interview, Markus Persson started coding at the age of 7 - that was around 1986 or 1987.
    Notch's first game was a "very basic text adventure" he made at the age of eight, 1987 or 1988. It is currently
    unknown if any of these games or notch's first Commodore 128 are still with Notch or his parents.
  </p>

  <h4>DOS Era</h4>
  <p>
    Notch used to make games under his studio's name "BitSeven Productions". He shared screenshots and some basic info
    about the games in an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110320152953/http://imgur.com/a/B5WkP">imgur post</a>,
    but for your comfort, you can check them out by going <a href="bitseven/">here</a>. None of these games were
    probably publicly released.
  </p>

  <h3>The Intra Clinic (2001-2003)</h3>
  <h4>2001 - The Intra Clinic's rise</h4>
  <p>
    Around 2001, Notch bought the Intra Clinic website (theintraclinic.com) and hosted his work there. This includes
    games, music, and of course - cryptic messages.<br>
    <li>
      The first known game here released here was <a href="loc-2001/">Legend of the Chambered</a>. Notch made multiple
      games with this name, and this is the very first one. It is sadly currently lost, but you can check out the <a
        href="loc-2001/original.html">original site</a>, or a <a href="loc-2001/alt.html">later version</a> of it. The
      game had multiple versions, most likely starting with 0.1.0, but the earliest with proof is 0.1.4 thanks to the
      changelog.
    </li>

    <li>
      Notch also made an applet that would load if you entered the website. It was an animated logo of The Intra Clinic.
      We have found this on archive.org, but can't figure out how to run it for now. If we ever do, we will make sure to
      update this.
    </li>

    <li>
      Notch then made a multiplayer RPG-like game called <a href="droj/index.html">Droj</a>. It is currently lost and
      the archived site doesn't contain much information.
    </li>
  </p>

  <h4>2002</h4>
  <p>
    <li>
      DachonB was a multiplayer gravity thruster type game with collision and sound engine. It was released around May.
    </li>

        at the same time I was doing my j3d doom engine, and it was about then I realized j3d was way too slow to make
