  <h2>Archive</h2>
  <p>This is the main directory for everything that we have archived. While we primarily archive the works of Markus
    "Notch" Persson, we do archive other projects, like Infiniminer. Below, you'll find all the projects in our archive,
    sorted by release dates in chronological order. If you're looking for something, use the search feature

  <h3>The early ages (1987-199X/200X)</h3>
  <h4>Childhood</h4>
  <p>
    According to an interview, Markus Persson started coding at the age of 7 - that was around 1986 or 1987.
    Notch's first game was a "very basic text adventure" he made at the age of eight, 1987 or 1988. It is currently
    unknown if any of these games or notch's first Commodore 128 are still with Notch or his parents.

  <h4>BitSeven Productions Era</h4>
  <p>
    Notch used to make games under his studio's name "BitSeven Productions". He shared screenshots and some basic info
    about the games in an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110320152953/http://imgur.com/a/B5WkP">imgur post</a>,
    but for your comfort, you can check them out by going <a href="bitseven/">here</a>. None of these games were
    probably publicly released.<br>

  <h3>The Intra Clinic (2001-2002)</h3>
  <h4>2001</h4>
  <p>
    Around 2001, Notch bought the Intra Clinic website (theintraclinic.com) and hosted his work there. This includes
    games, music, and of course - cryptic messages.<br>

    <li>
      <a href="loc-2001/">Legend of the Chambered</a> was the first known game released on theintraclinic in July 2001,
      and is also the first known game with this title, as more were to come. Multiple versions of it existed, as
      written in the changelog. If you want to read more about this, visit the original page, located <a
        href="loc-2001/">here</a>. This game is currently lost.<br>
      <img src="loc-2001/img/logo.gif">

    </li><br>

    <li>
      SiteApplet was an applet that would load if you entered the website. It was an animated logo of The Intra Clinic.
      We have found this on archive.org, but can't figure out how to run it for now. If we ever do, we will make sure to
      update this.

    </li><br>

    <li>
      <a href="droj/index.html">Droj</a> was a game hosted on Notch's computer, which suggests it was multiplayer.
      Nothing is known about Droj, as it is currently lost and the archived site doesn't contain much information.
    </li>
  </p>

  <h4>2002</h4>
  <p>
    <li>
      DachonB was a multiplayer gravity thruster type game with collision and sound engine. It was released around May.
      It is currently lost, including the site and the JNLP file.<br>
      Here's the original description of it by Notch:<br>
      <i>
        "It’s pretty much a normal thruster or gravity type game, except no singleplayer at all. Some of the cooler
        thing in there is the collision detecion, the beanshell-enabled console and the sound engine. I was doing this
        at the same time I was doing my j3d doom engine, and it was about then I realized j3d was way too slow to make
        anything “real” in. In my humble opinion, of course, so you j3d zealots can drop the pitchforks."
      </i>
    </li><br>

    <li>
      <a href="stark/">Stark</a> was a DOOM clone made in Java released around May. It could load WAD files. The JAR
      file, the J3D version and the source code are lost, but the rest of the website is archived. Notch abandoned this
      project after not being able to fix a sprite issue.<br>
