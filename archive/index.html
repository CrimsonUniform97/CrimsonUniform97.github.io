We archive every piece of content Notch left behind him on the internet: games, music, websites, etc.. Here, you'll find
everything we currently have archived. Everything is sorted by year of creation, but the best way to search is by using
your browser's search tool.<br>
<em>(We also archive other games like <a href="/archive/infiniminer">Infiniminer</a>; but we don't archive Minecraft.
  For that, visit <a href="https://omniarchive.net">Omniarchive</a>)</em><br>

<b>The early ages (1987-199X/200X)</b><br><br>
<em>Childhood</em><br>
<li>
  According to an interview, Markus Persson started coding at the age of 7 - that was around 1986 or 1987.
  Notch's first game was a "very basic text adventure" he made at the age of eight, 1987 or 1988. It is currently
  unknown if any of these games or notch's first Commodore 128 are still with Notch or his parents.<br><br>

</li>

<em>90s</em><br>
<li><a href="/archive/bitseven">BitSeven Productions</a> was Notch's first "studio", under which he created the earliest
  known games. He shared screenshots and some basic info about the games in an interview in 2011. All BitSeven games
  were created for DOS using the Turbo Pascal integrated development environment. None of these games are archived, they
  were never shared in the first place. All you can do is check out the screenshots.

<b>The Intra Clinic (2001-2002)</b><br><br>
<em>2001</em><br>

<li>
  <a href="loc-2001/">Legend of the Chambered</a> is the oldest known game released on TheIntraClinic in July 2001, and
  is also the first game of this title. It was a first person dungeon romp, similar to games like Dungeon Master in the
  form of a java applet. It started as an experimental engine dor this type of games, but Notch liked working on it so
  he kept expanding it for a while. Multiple versions were released, however none is currrently archived.

  <a href="droj/index.html">Droj</a> was a multiplayer game hosted on Notch's computer. Nothing is known about Droj, as

<b>2002</b>
<li>
  DachonB was a multiplayer j3D gravity thruster type game with collision detection, a console and a sound engine. It
  was being worked on around the same time as Stark, and released around May 2002. Development was cancelled due to
  Notch realizing j3D being too slow to make anything "real" in. The game alongside a screenshot is currently lost.<br>
  <a href="https://jvm-gaming.org/t/my-previous-game-abandoned/15979/">Here</a>'s the original post on the jvm-gaming
  forums.
</li><br>

<li>
  <a href="stark/">Stark</a> was a j3D 2.5 graphics engine, whose main functionality as loading DOOM WADs. It was being
  developed around the same time as DachonB, and it released around May. Almost all DOOM levels rendered perfectly,
  except the sky in DOOM 2 levels. Notch lost interest and abandoned the project after having an issue with sprite
  rendering. He also later released the source code. Only the website is currently archived, making the game itself, the
  j3D version and the source code lost.<br>
  <a href="https://jvm-gaming.org/t/my-previous-game-abandoned/15979/2">Here</a>'s a mention about it on the jvm-gaming

<b>Mojang AB (2003-2007)</b><br><br>
<em>2003</em><br>
<li>
  <a href="wurm/">WURM Online</a> is an MMO RPG that Notch worked on with Rolf Jansson, who founded Mojang AB together.
  Development started sometime in 2003. Notch was developing the game's client until 2007, when he left the company,
  which later changed it's name. There is a lot more about Wurm, check out the dedicated page.<br>

<li>
  Mojang's SiteApplet was an applet that would load if you entered the Mojang website. Works for me (Win2K). There was a
  big C-shaped “Mojang Specifications” logo, and when you clicked it, it split into four half-sized logos that bounce
  apart a little. When you clicked any of them, they again split and bounced apart. After the 5th split the parts
  vanished after bouncing.<br>

    Competition</a> in January 2005. It was a Sonic game with stolen sprites. Some of the code was based on <a
    href="stark/">Stark</a>. You can read the original thread <a
    href="https://jvm-gaming.org/t/sonicracer4k/21633">here</a>. It later mutated into a voxel game engine, as said
  <a href="https://jvm-gaming.org/t/dungeon4k/22008">here</a>. Notch forgot to make a backup of the racer source
  code, so he abandoned it. The game was lost but was recently found in a compilation of Java4k entries.<br>
