  <p>This is the main directory for everything that we have archived. While we primarily archive the works of Markus
    "Notch" Persson, we do archive others, like Infiniminer. See the topic directory below for all the games in that
    topic, or take a look at the list of featured games.

    Not much is known about Droj, all we really know is that the servers for it were being hosted on Notch's computer.

    It is a j3d version of a game Notch made for work.<br>
    "It’s pretty much a normal thruster or gravity type game, except no singleplayer at all. Some of the cooler thing in
    there is the collision detecion, the beanshell-enabled console and the sound engine. I was doing this at the same
    time I was doing my j3d doom engine, and it was about then I realized j3d was way too slow to make anything “real”
    in. In my humble opinion, of course, so you j3d zealots can drop the pitchforks."<br>
    Sadly, this game is lost, including screenshots and the webpage for it.
