  <h2>Archive</h2>
  <p>This is the main directory for everything that we have archived. While we primarily archive the works of Markus
    "Notch" Persson, we do archive others, like Infiniminer. See the topic directory below for all the games in that
    topic, or take a look at the list of featured games.
