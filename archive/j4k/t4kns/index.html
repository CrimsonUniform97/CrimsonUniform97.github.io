<strong>Instructions</strong><br>
Left click units to select them, right click the game board to move them.<br>
Left click buildings to select them, select an option in the menu to the right to build it.<br>
Send harvesters to gems to gather them, then send then to the headquarters to earn money.<br>
Buildings can only be built on concrete, concrete can only be built next to other concrete. Nothing can be built out of line-of-sight.<br>
If the map sucks, simply reload the page to start over.<br>
Oh, and you can't win the game yet. You're supposed to win if you blow up the enemy base, and lose if the enemy blows up your base.<br>
