    <h3>Game rules</h3>
    The goal of Miners is to dig tunnels that lead the Miners to the gold, then back to the starting position again.<br>
    The miners are simple creatures:
    <ul>
        <li>Miners will walk straight forward until they hit a wall or get bored.
        <li>When a miner hits gold, he will pick up a chunk of the gold, but only if he isn't already carrying some
            gold.
        <li>If a miner carrying gold enters either starting platform, he will drop the gold there.
        <li>When a miner faces a steep cliff in front of him, there's a 66% chance he will try to jump over it.
        <li>After a miner has hit a wall and changed direction, there's a 66% he will jump back in the direction he came
            from.
        <li>A miner that falls more than 100 pixels will die.
    </ul>
