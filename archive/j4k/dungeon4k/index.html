    <h3>About</h3>
    Dungeon4k is a game written in <a href="/http://www.java.com/">java</a>,
    and looks similar to games like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder.<br>
    It was written by <a href="mailto:markus@mojang.com">Markus Persson</a>
    as an entry for a java 4KB game programming competition, and takes up exactly 4KB (4096 bytes) including all
    graphics and packaging (jnlp and this website excluded).<br>


    <h3>Play!</h3>
    <a href="Dungeon4k.jnlp">Play now via webstart</a>, or if you want to play the game in fullscreen mode (you should,
    it's a lot more fun), <a href="Dungeon4k.jar">download Dungeon.jar</a>, then run
    "<code>java -cp Dungeon4k.jar D</code>".

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    The goal of Dungeon4k is to collect as many diamonds as possible before the energy runs out.<br>
    To do this, you will need to find keys for locked doors, refill your energy, and cast powerful spells.<br>
