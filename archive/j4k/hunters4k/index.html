    <h3>About</h3>
    Hunters4k is an action packed first person shooter written in <a
        href="http://www.java.com/">java</a>.<br>
    It was written by <a href="mailto:markus@mojang.com">Markus Persson</a>
    as an entry for a java 4KB game programming competition, and takes up exactly 4KB (4096 bytes) including all
    graphics and packaging (jnlp and this website excluded).<br>


    <h3>Play!</h3>
    To play Hunters4k, first make sure you have java installed, then <a href="Hunters4k.jar">download Hunters4k.jar</a>
    and run "<code>java -cp Hunters4k.jar D</code>". If you wish to run Hunters4k in a window, run
    "<code>java -cp Hunters4k.jar D window</code>" instead.<br>
    A webstartable version is unfortunately not available since Hunters4k uses a java.awt.Robot, and I don't have room
    left in the 4k to sign the jar file.

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    The goal of Hunters4k is to kill as many hunters as possible before you die.<br>
    For every hunter you kill, you gain ten points. Every time you fire your gun, you lose one point.<br>
    If a hunter touches you, it will "Blink" you, causing 10 points of damage. When your health reaches 0, the game is
    over.
