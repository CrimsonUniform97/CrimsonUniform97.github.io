    <h2>About</h2>
    Blast Passage was made by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081017182423/http://www.mojang.com/notch/">Markus
        Persson</a>.
    It is an entry in the 2008 <a href="http://www.retroremakes.com/">Retro
        Remakes</a> competition, in the 8 bit
    mashup category.<br>
    You can play it <a
        href="index.html">here</a>.
    <p>
        The game is more or less a straight mix between <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman">Bomberman</a>
        and <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_(arcade_game)">Gauntlet</a>,
        using enemies and levels from
        Gauntlet, and the main character, attack system and power-ups from Bomberman.<br>
        The graphics limitations and sound capabilities are intentionally similar to those an 8-bit game console.
        Specifically, the graphics have the same limitations as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Master_System">Sega Master
            System</a>, while the sound is similar to
        the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_SID">sound
            chip in a Commodore 64</a>.
    <p>
        There's no copyrighted material in the game. While the graphics might appear similar to that of the original
        games,
        everything has been made from scratch (in <a
            href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.net</a>).

        <br><br>
    <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
    First of all, make sure that you have <a
        href="http://www.java.com/">Java</a> installed.
    <p>
        To play the game, simply go <a
            href="index.html">here</a>.
        Instructions on how to
        play are included in the game from the main menu.<br>
        To play the game offline, download <a href="BlastPassageOffline.zip">this file</a>, then
        open index.html in a web browser.<br>
        To host your own multiplayer server, download <a href="BlastPassageServer.zip">this file</a>, and
        follow the instructions in readme.txt.<br>

        <br><br>
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <strong>GRAPHICS</strong>
    <p>
        The screen resolution is 320x240 pixels, mostly because I LOOOVE that resolution, but also because the
        competition
        rules state that I have to show a splash screen of at least 640x480 pixels. Since I display the graphics at a X2
        zoom, this fits perfectly.
    <p>
        All graphics are limited to the Master System 6-bit palette:<br>
        <img src="about/mastersystempalette.png"
            float="left"><br>
        There's a sprite palette of 15 colors (+1 color for transparent) from that master palette which all moving
        graphics share.<br>
        Stationary graphics use another palette of 11 colors, with the last four colors dedicated for floor and wall
        graphics. That way, I can simply change the colors of the four last colors in that palette to dynamically change
        the colors of each level.
    <p>
        The only place I really cheat is with the number of visible sprites, and with the speed of the graphics
        rendering.
        The opening animation, for example, would probably not be possible on a real 8-Bit computer.
    <p>
        When loading the graphics, I apply some desaturation and gamma correction for a more genuine TV appearance.<br>
        If enabled in the options, I also do some minor image post processing that adds some slight vertical blur.
    <p>
        <br>
        <strong>SOUND</strong>
    <p>
        I didn't have the energy to implement a full SID emulation, so I made my own virtual sound chip called the SYD.
        It has the following specifications:

        <code><pre>
      3 Analogue Stereo Waveform Generators
      1 11KHZ 4-bit PCM player
      Programmable interrupt
      Ring modulation between any two waveform generators</pre></code>

        Any two waveform channels can be set to ring modulation mode. This overrides the stereo mode
        for both channels and outputs the result in the center channel.<br>
        The programmable interrupt used for triggering notes in music in a timely fashion.
    <p>
        Inputs for the waveform generators:

        <code><pre>
      bits | name        | description
      -----+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------
      16   | hz          | Starting HZ for the note
      16   | hztarget    | Ending HZ for the note. Used for slides
      4    | saw         | Saw waveform volume
      4    | triangle    | Triangle waveform volume
      4    | pulse       | Pulse waveform volume
      4    | noise       | Noise volume
      4    | duty        | The duty cycle of the pulse waveform
      16   | ADSR        | Four bits for each element. ADR is in logarithmic scale.
      2    | channel     | Stereo channel mode. 0=center. 1=left. 2=right. 3=sign split
      2    | filter      | Filter type. 0=no filter. 1=lowpass. 2=highpass. 3=bandpass
      4    | f.strength  | Strength of the filter
    </pre></code>

        Because 4 bit sound is fairly horrible, the PCM player does some dynamic range compression to avoid fuzz from
        low volume sounds. This slightly distorts the sound (it's an intentional "bug" :D).
    <p>
        I believe this should be a fairly accurate interpretation of the sound capabilities of 8 bit game consoles.
    <p>
        <br>
        <strong>GENERAL</strong>
    <p>
        The game runs at 60 hz regardless of computer power. If it's not possible to run the game fast enough,
        it does automatic frameskipping, but the logic still happens at 60 hz.
    <p>
        Collision detection, rendering, and monster updates all use the same fast space partitioning engine I made for
        this game. Basically, it just splits the level up into 64x64 pixel chunks and keeps a list of all sprites in
        each
        chunk, and provides some fast functions for getting all entities within a certain pixel area.
    <p>
        I totally ignore any cpu power or memory limitations of 8 bit computers, but I have tried to make the game run
        smoothly even on older computers. After disabling the fancy post processing in the options, the game runs at the
        full 60 fps even on the very old
        worst case test computer at work, so I'm very happy with the performance.
    <p>--<br>
        I hope you've enjoyed this game as much as I've enjoyed making it.<br>
