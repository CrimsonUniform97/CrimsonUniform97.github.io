    Hehe, of course some people just had to show how easy it was to hack, so I've disabled the ability to submit new
    scores, and reverted the
    highscore list to an older one. Thanks for the lesson. =)<br>
    <br>
    Oh, wow, there's a really nice review <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080828024147/http://dansdata.blogsome.com/2008/08/24/the-land-of-the-thirteen-pixel-warrior/">here</a>.
    Thank you, Daniel Rutter, for that awesome review!<br>
    Abut those really low high scores: Yeah, it seems unlikely. I've got the replay data for all high score entries, but
    unfortunately, the synchronization code is broken, so I can't replay
    anything predictably. If you're reading this and didn't cheat, you've GOT to tell me your strategy. Holy moly!<br>
    <br>
    I've made a post-LD12 update, fixing a few bugs, and adding a high score list.<br>
    Oh, and for the people who can't figure out how to win, here's a hint: <i>What is the tower made of?</i><br>

    Woo!

    <h2>Controls:</h2>
    Left mouse button selects buildings from the top, then places them in the game area.<br>
    Right mouse button rotates the map. Placing the mouse cursor near the sides of the game area also works.<br>
    That's it!
