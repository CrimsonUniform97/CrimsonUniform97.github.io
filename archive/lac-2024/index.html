  <h1>Levers and Chests (2024)</h1>
  <p>
    This page is meant to archive media related to Notch's new 2024 project - simply titled Levers and Chests (he used
    this name many times already, thus the 2024 in the title). The page will be updated with latest screenshots, news,
    and other related progress information. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/notch">@notch</a> and <a
      href="https://twitter.com/BitshiftEnt">@BitshiftEnt</a> for news in real time.<br>
    The game is currently heading for a roguelike looter shooter combined with a first person dungeon
    crawler [<a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1775347747933344195">*</a>]. It's written in JavaScript and
    WebGL [<a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1767958523051389120">*</a>].<br>
    There is currently no playable build of the game out.<br>

    Notch reassured he's still working on the game in a tweet <br>"<a
      href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1767599048624841114">Game Dev life is going well. I wake up excited to go
      to the office, feel surprised when it's already 6:30
      pm.<br>
      Current project is a dungeon crawler to get it out of my system.<br>
      That, and coming up with logos for the studio apparently, which some might say is premature. But fun.</a>".
  </p>

  <p>
    <date>January 31, 2024</date><br>
    Notch confirmed he's working on the game, a dungeon crawler, by the tweet "<a
      href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1752742425511264646">Some of you might have figured out I have an office I
      go to where I try to make a game now. No promises, I know myself almost as well as you know me, but it's feeling
      real positive.<br>Current plan is to maybe whip together a dungeon crawler to get us started. We'll see.</a>".
  </p>

  <p>
    <date>January 30, 2024</date><br>
    Notch tweets out "<a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1752288134983983207">So what game do you want?</a>",
    implying the game studio is actually happening.<br>
    He then tweets "<a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1752358057185780005">Hey @Microsoft
      , do you remember if I can use the name 0x10c, or if it ended up with you?</a>" later that day, implying he'd
    return to the game or at least possiby use the name for a similar project. It is unknown if they got back to him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <date>January 23, 2024</date><br>
    Notch tweets out "<a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1749743780172018008">Is "no1212ch" a good studio
      name?</a>", which I believe is the earliest indirect mention of doing something related to the project.
