    <h1>Droj</h1>
    If you see a small Droj-logo here (<img
        src="http://213.89.8.94:8080/droj/up.gif" width="40" height="17"
        border="0" align="center">), the Droj servers are up and running, and you can start playing by
    <a href="starting.html"
        onclick="MM_openBrWindow('https://web.archive.org/web/20021013211832/http://213.89.8.94:8080/droj/droj.html','_blank','location=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,width=600,height=400')">clicking
        here</a>.<br>
    Most of the time, however, the servers will be down. This is because I host Droj from my home PC.
    <p>
        When Droj asks you to log in, just enter your desired username and a random password. Currently, all logins are
        accepted as there is no database anywhere to be found on my computer.<br>
        Note that you will need <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013211832/http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html">Java 2, Standard
            Edition</a> version 1.3 or higher to play Droj.
    <p>
