<b>Dachon4k and Takns!</b><br>
<em>24th July 2023</em><br>
<img src="https://theintraclinic.com/archive/j4k/dachon4k/screenshot.gif"><br>
Phew, I really should use the news section whenever I update the site. Thanks to superllama on Discord, we now have the
original Takns jar (previously we only had a recompiled version from the source code), and... (applause, please) -
Dachon4k! This means we now have every Java4k game that notch has ever made!<br>

<b>New Java Download Section!</b><br>
<em>08-30-2021</em><br>
We added a Java download section! We currently have versions 5, 6, 7, and 8
of the Java Runtime Environment available for download. Keep in mind each
release linked may not be completely up to date, but they are the version we
recommend if you want to try to play some of the Java games we have hosted
here in our archive in your web browser. If you don't wish to do that, then we
recommend installing the latest version of Java.<br><br>Our <a href="https://theintraclinic.com/download/java">
