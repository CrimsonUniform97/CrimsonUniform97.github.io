We added a Java download section! We currently have versions 5, 6, 7, and 8
of the Java Runtime Environment available for download. Keep in mind each
release linked may not be completely up to date, but they are the version we
recommend if you want to try to play some of the Java games we have hosted
here in our archive in your web browser. If you don't wish to do that, then we
recommend installing the latest version of Java.<br><br>Our <a href="https://theintraclinic.com/download/java">
